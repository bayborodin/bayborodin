But, my primary goal is to get a good-payed remote job as a server-side web developer. If to look at the situation through the prism of my goal, then PHP is more suitable, than JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>So, I had canceled my Backend JS programme and started a new - PHP developer. The next week I&rsquo;ll tell you what success (really?!) I have achieved on my new way.</p>")) ((? . 0) f post (u .
