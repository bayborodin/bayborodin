Oops&hellip; My name is Nicholas. I&rsquo;m the software engineer from Russia. In this post, I will write few words about me and about this blog.</p>\n\n<p>This blog is a chronicle about my way on IT. The fact is that I decided to make a pivot in my carrier. More than twenty years I have worked as a 1C developer.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s 1C, so I&rsquo;ll talk about it shortly. 1C is the famous Russian ERP system. It is used by about 99% of all companies in Russia. 1C is built on the three-tier architecture, and a couple years ago there was a web version. Although 1C is written in C++, an internal programming language is used for configuration and customization.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s very popular platform in Russia, but I have decided to change my specialization. For this I have several reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>1C is unknown outside Russian Federation, but want to communicate with software developers from all over the world;</li>\n <li>I constantly feel the need to study something new, the need to try modern progressive technologies. But it is impossible while living inside along software platform.</li>\n <li>This software platform has a lot of weaknesses. But the platform&rsquo;s vendor doesn&rsquo;t plan to fix most of them in foreseeable future.</li></ul>\n\n<p>So I decided to change my specialization and to learn new technologies and programming languages, which I&rsquo;ve interested in.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s serverside JavaScript (Node.js and related technologies). The next, the functional programming paradigm and functional programming languages, such as Haskell, Racket, and Clojure. And I want to understand the operation systems internals -on this way, the C/C++, exactly as their new reincarnation - Go, will be useful for me.</p>\n\n<p>I plan to write notes for this blog at least once a week and describe my progress, frustrations and success cases. I&rsquo;ll share interesting and useful links. And, maybe sometimes I&rsquo;ll tell you interesting stories about my day-by-day life in Russia.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be glad to receive any feedback from you! And I wish we will be friends. Bye..</p>"))))
