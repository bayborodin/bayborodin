&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year, my friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the fact that I have not written anything for a long time. Just it was no interesting something to write about. All this time I was thinking about whether I chose the right direction. JavaScript is a great programmig language, but I noticed that working with him does not bring me moral satisfaction, as I would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long been tormented by doubts - to continue what has been started, or to pause and understand what I really want to achieve professionally. And finally I&amp;rsquo;ve made a decision. Surprisingly, it is very simple. It does not matter what others say and write - you need to do what you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering everything that I did during the last year, I realized that I felt most comfortable in the Java world. I like everething there - a language, an infrastructure, a community. And, I made the final decision. If there is a sense to spend on your time and effort, then let it be Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, all my further notes will be dedicated to describing my path in the Java world. I hope you will be interested. Let&amp;rsquo;s start!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
