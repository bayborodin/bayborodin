&lt;p&gt;Hi, all! My name is Harry Potter. Oops&amp;hellip; My name is Nicholas. I&amp;rsquo;m the software engineer from Russia. In this post, I will write few words about me and about this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is a chronicle about my way on IT. The fact is that I decided to make a pivot in my carrier. More than twenty years I have worked as a 1C developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s 1C, so I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about it shortly. 1C is the famous Russian ERP system. It is used by about 99% of all companies in Russia. 1C is built on the three-tier architecture, and a couple years ago there was a web version. Although 1C is written in C++, an internal programming language is used for configuration and customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s very popular platform in Russia, but I have decided to change my specialization. For this I have several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;1C is unknown outside Russian Federation, but want to communicate with software developers from all over the world;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;I constantly feel the need to study something new, the need to try modern progressive technologies. But it is impossible while living inside along software platform.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;This software platform has a lot of weaknesses. But the platform&amp;rsquo;s vendor doesn&amp;rsquo;t plan to fix most of them in foreseeable future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to change my specialization and to learn new technologies and programming languages, which I&amp;rsquo;ve interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s serverside JavaScript (Node.js and related technologies). The next, the functional programming paradigm and functional programming languages, such as Haskell, Racket, and Clojure. And I want to understand the operation systems internals -on this way, the C/C++, exactly as their new reincarnation - Go, will be useful for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to write notes for this blog at least once a week and describe my progress, frustrations and success cases. I&amp;rsquo;ll share interesting and useful links. And, maybe sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you interesting stories about my day-by-day life in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to receive any feedback from you! And I wish we will be friends. Bye..&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
