### Hi there! 👋

I'm Nikolay. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my spare time I learn I study sections of Computer Science that are new to me, new technologies and software development practices that interest me. _(normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work)_ and experiments with code.
