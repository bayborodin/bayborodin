# Bio
My name is Nicholas. I live in Khabarovsk, Russia, and I’d prefer local or remote work, but I’m potentially willing relocate, depending on the location.

# Things I’m good at
## Programming languages
I spend a lot of time studying the features and specifics of the programming languages ​​with which I have to use. This gives me a deep understanding of the possibilities and limitations of a particular programming language. And, as a consequence, I can make the right choice of tools at the start of the new project.

## Web applictions and APIs

# Things I like to use

# Other things I’m good at
