# Bio
My name is Nicholas. I live in Khabarovsk, Russia, and I’d prefer local or remote work, but I’m potentially willing relocate, depending on the location.

# Things I’m good at
## Programming languages
I spend a lot of time studying the features and specifics of the programming languages ​​with which I have to use. This gives me a deep understanding of the possibilities and limitations of a particular programming language. And, as a consequence, I can make the right choice of tools at the start of the new project.

## Web applictions and APIs
## Libraries and developing tooling

# Things I like to use
## JavaScript
## C/C++

# Other things I’m good at
## Go
## Haskell
## Racket
I use Racket for my education projects, and as one of languages for learnig functional programming anf SICP.
In addition, I use Racket as a tool for developing this blog. The fact is that as a platform for the blog, I chose the static site generator Frog. Frog is not only written in Racket, but also uses this language to configure and configure templates.
## Docker
## AWS
