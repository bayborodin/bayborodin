# Bio
My name is Nicholas Bayborodin. I live in Khabarovsk, Russia, and I’d prefer local or remote work, but I’m potentially willing relocate, depending on the location.

## Things I’m good at
### Programming languages
I spend a lot of time studying the features and specifics of the programming languages ​​with which I have to use. This gives me a deep understanding of the possibilities and limitations of a particular programming language. And, as a consequence, I can make the right choice of tools at the start of the new project.

### Web applictions and APIs
I’ve been working with web tech for most of my programming lifetime, and I know how to design user-friendly applications and strong, stable APIs. I know how to encode most domains into a type system in such a way that makes the most common bugs **impossible**, and I can build embedded languages that make things like database queries and templating safe, efficient, and concise.

### Libraries and developing tooling
I dedicate most of my free time to developing and maintaining open source software, and I know how to write and document watertight abstractions that can be used and reused. I approach library interfaces from a user experience perspective as well as a technical one.

## Things I like to use
### Go
### C/C++

## Other things I’m good at
### PHP
I am not expert in both PHP as a language and the PHP ecosystem. It’s not my favorite technology in the world, but knowing the language and its tools is pretty important for building modern web applications.

### JavaScript
### Haskell
### Racket

## Other things I'm good at
### Docker

### AWS
In large part because I like to stay as far away from “operations” as I possibly can, I’ve gotten pretty good at understanding how to safely and reliably deploy infrastructure on AWS in a way that won’t ever require me to ssh into a production box. Most notably, I’m knowledgable in creating software-defined architecture, architecture that can be tracked in version control, reliably replicated as necessary, and hooked together to coordinate between independent subsystems.
