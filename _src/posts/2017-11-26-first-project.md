It was a special week.

The matter is that I pass training in online school Hexlet.io under the program Backend JavaScript Developer. The process consists of a series of video lessons, text material, and inactive programming tasks. But, the most valuable are the projects. The project is a big task, looking at the stages. The aim of the student is to follow all the steps under the direction of the mentor and get the finished software product.

In this case, your work is checked by the mentor, accepting or rejecting the assignments. Mentor gives practical advice on how to properly organize the structure of the project, helps build the life cycle of the development process. Does the code review.

The project is limited in terms of - you need to meet and fulfill all tasks within one week. As a good incentive for diligent work on the project is the fact that participation in the project is paid. It's a shame not to meet the deadlines, and in vain to spend money without getting a badge as a result, confirming that you are a hero.

The purpose of the first project is to introduce JavaScript infrastructure, to teach how to collect and publish npm modules, and also to teach correct approaches to the organization of the application structure. The task is to write a set of small console games for the knowledge of elementary mathematics.

The most vivid impression of this project is despair and a desire to throw it somewhere in the middle. Imagine, you throw all the affairs, work, only deal with the project, giving it all the strength. And, behold, you are sending the task for verification. Not accepted. You correct mistakes - it is not accepted ... You reapply again and again - it is not accepted ... The sensation is not the most pleasant;) But, fortunately, for this case, there is a mentor who, having asked the right questions, helps to find the right decision.


I can not but note the practical value of the project. In the process of its implementation, I learned how to collect and publish the npm project, learned how to use ESLint, Babel and Make scripts. I learned how to connect the project to Travis CI and to Code Climate, and also to post on the Readme of my Github project beautiful badges.

But, most importantly - the project has inspired me to take the next steps in the chosen direction - Backend JavaScript Developer.
