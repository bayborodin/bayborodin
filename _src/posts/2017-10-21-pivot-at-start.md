Last week a has started to learn the server-side JavaScript. As for education platform (MOOC), I've selected Hexlet. <a href='@|https://hexlet.io|'>@|Hexlet|</a> is one of more authoritative education platforms in Russia. It offers several learning paths - Frontend JavaScript Developer, Backend JavaScript Developer, PHP Developer and Java Developer.

The "Backend JavaScript Developer" is the deeper and more conceptual programme and I has made a decision to start learning on this programme.
I've completed some lessons and had planned to continue my education, but when I have studied proposals on the IT jobs market, I was surprised...

I saw a lot of PHP jobs and only a few jobs related to Node.js.

Yes, I'm very interested in Node.js and related technologies. But, my primary goal is to get a good-payed remote job as a server-side web developer. If to look at the situation through the prism of my goal, then PHP is more suitable, than JavaScript.

So, I had canceled my Backend JS programme and started a new - PHP developer.
The next week I'll tell you what success (really?!) I have achieved on my new way.
